* Pinned both Dockerfiles to SRG v0.4.1.

## [0.9.7]

### Changed
* Updated `dem.ensure_egm_model_available` to use the EGM Model stored in a public `LAVAS` AWS account

## [0.9.6]

### Changed
* `dem.download_dem_for_srg` now returns a dem with pixels 5m wide and 15m tall, rather than 30m x 30m
* `time_series.create_time_series` now generates interferograms using 6x2 looks, rather than 2x2
* Reduced maximum temporal baseline for time series SBAS network to 60 days from 90

## [0.9.5]

### Added
* `--hyp3-deployment` parameter to `submit_time_series_job.py` script to support submitting jobs to hyp3-lavas-test

### Changed
* Default number of looks for time series step from 10x10 to 2x2

## [0.9.4]

### Added
* `submit_time_series_job.py` helper script for submitting SRG_TIME_SERIES jobs to https://hyp3-lavas.asf.alaska.edu

## [0.9.3]

### Removed
* Removed ability to pass [0, 0, 0, 0] as bounds

## [0.9.2]

### Added
* Added `mypy` to [`static-analysis`](.github/workflows/static-analysis.yml)

## [0.9.1]

### Changed
* The [`static-analysis`](.github/workflows/static-analysis.yml) Github Actions workflow now uses `ruff` rather than `flake8` for linting.

## [0.9.0]

### Added
* A new `--use-gslc-prefix` option has been added to the `back_projection` and `time_series` workflows:
  * This option causes `back_projection` to upload the GSLC outputs to a `GSLC_granules/` subprefix located within the S3 bucket and prefix given by the `--bucket` and `--bucket-prefix` options.
  * This option causes `time_series` to download the GSLC inputs from the `GSLC_granules/` subprefix located within the bucket and prefix given by the `--bucket` and `--bucket-prefix` options.

### Changed
* Releases and test deployments now trigger a Docker build for the GPU container, rather than the CPU container.

### Fixed
* Fixed the parsing for the `--bounds` option for `time_series`.

## [0.8.0]

### Added
* New `time_series` workflow for time series processing of GSLC stacks.

### Changed
* The `back_projection` workflow now accepts an optional `--bounds` parameter to specify the DEM extent
* The back-projection product now includes the elevation.dem.rsc file.

## [0.7.0]

### Changed
* Renamed project to HyP3 SRG to reflect that it's a HyP3 plugin for the Stanford Radar Group (SRG) SAR Processor.

## [0.6.0]

### Changed
* Orbit files are now retrieved using `fetch_for_scene` from `s1_orbits`.
* ESA Credentials are no longer needed.

## [0.5.2]
